            <p class="bio">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian<br>aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the<br>11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was<br>born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and<br>studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent<br>the next four decades as a scientist and science<br>administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and<br> Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space<br>Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately <br>involved in India's civilian space programme and military<br>missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as<br>the Missile Man of India for his work on the development<br>of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also<br>played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role<br>in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the<br>original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
